Over the last 3 years I have started having night terrors. I also had them when I was a child, but they stopped when I was about 7. When I wake up from these nightmares I am still dreaming and completely involved in a very scary hallucination. I can have conversations and even explain what is happening while the terror is still occurring, but usually the hallucination will dissapear while I am explaining it. It actually looks like it is disolving. After it is over I am pale and covered in sweat. I normally feel light headed and the memory of what just occured begins to fade immediatley. I feel confused and sleep does not come easily for an hour or so. I guess I dream in extremes because if it is not a night terror it is usually something so vivid and colorful. Something very real. Sometimes the dreams are so beautiful that it is painful to wake up.")
